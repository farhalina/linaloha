/*

Step 1: 
Create a basic layout of what you'd want your website to look like
- Use figma (1-2 hours max)
- Design path (routes, pages, etc.) (1-2 hours)

Step 2: 
- Break each path down into separate components first (10-20 mins)
- Design each component - focus on main page first, then sub pages

Step 3: 
- Create containers for each element in main page and other pages
- Get working links/add personality/confetti/video embed, etc. 

Step 4: 
- Style and make pretty 
- Share with Dan/friends/family
